# imdb-crawler
simple web scraper that gets some general movie information from IMDB. The technologies we will be using to accomplish this are:
NodeJS
ExpressJS: The Node framework that everyone uses and loves.
Request: Helps us make HTTP calls
Cheerio: Implementation of core jQuery specifically for the server (helps us traverse the DOM and extract data)
